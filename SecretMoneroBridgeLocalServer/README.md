We created this application to address a security risk with the Keplr wallet extension.

The binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows can be downloaded from the **Secret Monero Bridge Gateway Checker** page at: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNRrLDhKGZCSXAZcPU1cBTaLouhWnTi5kfWUzJB4nJbzA

We opened an issue on the Keplr github: https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-extension/issues/136

The security risk is described in the document named: KeplrWalletSecurityRisk.pdf
The document can be obtained via IPFS: QmYgNyDJ4zvjKePy3Ti2Jdmq2Boiw7LEXLBLKZ9pEZqYqA
